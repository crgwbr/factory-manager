The account management team at Maker's Row occasionally enters factory details in an admin page specifically for that reason. In this exercise, you're required to do the following:

## Build it
* Build a web based CRUD app for managing factories - a user should be able to enter factory details and show a list of factories already in the system.
* Details of data for a factory: Name, Email, Address, list of tags
* Host the code on Github
* Have this built in the selected language (we'll pick one for you) in a framework of your choice.

## Deploy it
* Create a Vagrant virtual machine that will host the web application
* Create an Ansible playbook that provisions the Vagrant virtual machine with all the application code and its dependencies
* Application should be accessible through http://localhost:7000/

## Bonus
* Create a stateless REST Api using factory as the resource.
* Plot out the geo locations of the factories in the system and plot them on a US map.

## Be prepared to discuss:
* Learnings along the way
* Challenges
